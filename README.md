# An archive of my firstyear project

> Working title: A pipeline for automated facial expression coding in dyads using OpenFace (feat. a replication study)

## Description

As a clinical psychology graduate student, I have spent my first year at Ohio State working on my firstyear project. I used [OpenFace](https://github.com/TadasBaltrusaitis/OpenFace) to analyze the facial behavior of mother-daughter dyads from [Crowell et al. 2013](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23581508/). The main goal of this project was to replicate results from [Haines et al. 2019](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30919792/). Secondary goals included vector autoregression and having fun.

This project will be presented to faculty and students on May 12th 2021. I will try to have all the code and presentation slides uploaded here before then. I'll include long and short versions of the presentation here since I only have fifteen minutes to present on May 12th.
